### *This is an early wip draft*

## Goals and Motivation

We would like to enable users to use popular hardware wallets and mobile wallets to protect their Spacemesh account and smart wallet private keys and to be able to easily and safely sing transactions using hardware wallets and popular mobile wallets.

We would like to enable users of Smapp and CLIWallet, the reference Spacemesh wallets, to use popular hardware wallets to security sign transactions.

We want to have a simple and straight-forward integration story with 3rd party wallet developers and hardware wallets makers so they can add support to Spacemesh transactions quickly post Spacemesh mainent genesis.

We would like to minimize the amount of work that Spacemesh hardware walelts and mobile wallets partners need to invest in order to support Spacemesh.

We would like to reduce the security risk which is involved in introducing a new signature scheme which is not yet audited by the security community.

## Tech Background
Go-spacemesh, the full node implementation of the Spacemesh protocol currently only supports a new custom signature scheme we call `ED25519++` which is based on the standard `ED25519` signature scheme and in addition supports extraction of public keys from signatures and messages. Reference: https://github.com/spacemeshos/ed25519

`ED25519++` allows Spacemesh to reduce transaction size which is important as it lowers the mesh growth rate, as less bytes needs to be stored on the mesh per transaction.

If we keep only supporting the `ED25519++` signature scheme then any hardware wallet or mobile wallet product will need to implement this scheme in order to support signing Spacemesh transactions.

For hardware wallets, the scheme will have to be developed, tested and secured for the device firmware and distributed to customers via a firmware update.

## The Proposed Solution

### Overview

Add support to standard to the standard `ED25519` signature scheme for Spacemesh transactions to the Spacemesh full node and specifications.

Spacemesh wallets such as Smapp and CLIWallet will use the `ED25519++` scheme by default to sign transactions (when used as hot-wallets) and these wallets will create transactions data which exclude signature public key.

When a user signs a Spacemesh transaction using a hardware wallet or use a third party mobile wallet, the standard `ED2519` signature scheme will be used and the transaction will include the signature public key.


When hardware wallets and mobile wallets add support to `ED25519++`, Spacemesh wallet front-ends will be updated and use this signature scheme for signing and legacy `ED25119` signature scheme usage should be gradually phased out.


### Pros
Once this support is added, adding support for Spacemesh signatures in all major hardware wallet becomes a trivial integration project as `ED25119` capabilities are already well supported and tested on all major hardware wallets. The integration becomes much straight-forward as there's no need to implement and to secure a new signature scheme on the device.

Similarly, integration with any 3rd party wallets which support other major cryptocurrencies becomes trivial as it is highly-likely that these wallets already support `ED25519` as it is becoming popular scheme for use with cryptocurrencies.

Having this simpler integration can ensure that major wallets will add support quickly to Spacemesh mainnet.

In addition, this design also enables Spacemesh to quickly add hardware-wallets support to its own reference wallets - Smapp and CLiWallet and to have more time to test these integrations prior to mainnet launch.

Users of Spacemesh planned Smart Wallets features enabled by SVM will be able to use any major hardware wallet to manage their master wallet keys and to use hardware wallet for multi-sig signing which adds an important additional layer of security to this important capability.

From a partnership perspective, choosing a simple integration instead of a highly complex one as proposed here dramatically increases the chances of a partnership materializing quickly which is important for Spacemesh.

### Cons
1. Accounts which use hardware wallet can be singled out. Mitigated by the fact that accounts with a large balance are already singled out as there's no balance privacy on the mesh.

2. Transaction size is bigger for `ED25519` transaction due to inclusion of public key.

3. Increased transaction processing logic implementaiton complexity.

## Dependencies and Interactions


## Pending research


## Interaction with existing code-

## Implementation details
- Add ed25519 transaction type to transaction type field.
- Specify canonical ed25519 transaction data format.
- Add ed25519 support to transaction processing (STF).

- Transaction signature type field will indicate what signature scheme is used or the current transaction type field can be used to add a legacy transaction type.

- Transactions signed with `ED25519` will need to include the signing public key in the transaction data.

# Data Design

## Motivation

Spacemesh aims to build and release a minimally viable cryptocurrency mainnet which is powered by the Spacemesh consensus protocol. The primary use case of any cryptocurrency is the ability of anyone to transact w/o limitations. Transacting means the ability to submit transactions and to know the results of transactions executed by the system that a user may be involved in (as a sender, receiver, singer, etc...). Another important use case is smeshers getting rewards and transaction fees for honest participation in the protocol. For miners, it is utterly important to know exactly what fees and rewards they got credit for, in what time (layer) did they get rewarded and why did they get rewarded a specific amount in a layer.

The data required to implement these use cases on the most basic level does not live explicitly in the core Spacemesh distributed data structure we call the mesh due to the design of the Spacemesh consensus protocol.

This document aims to define what data needs to be collected, stored and made available by a Spacemesh node in a way will enable Spacemesh to be a minimally viable cryptocurrency.

Specifically, this document lays out what data will be stored by a Spacemesh full node in addition to the core mesh data required for the Spacemesh consensus protocol, and how and when these data should be computed by a Spacemesh full node. While there's team consensus about the contents of the mesh, further attention and thought are needed around what data are needed that are not explicitly stored on the mesh.

The Spacemesh [data API](https://github.com/spacemeshos/api) provides access to these data as mesh data alone is insufficient for many API consumers. A consensus on the above is required to design a functional API and to design API clients such as backup agents, explorers, wallets, and dashboards. All of these clients consume Spacemesh data and most of them require data beyond the basic, raw mesh data.

This formulation is important due to the special and unique design of the Spacemesh consensus protocol and mesh and the implication of the consensus protocol design on creating a functional cryptocurrency based on it.

## The Mesh
Core data that the Spacemesh protocol provides decentralized consensus on is called the "mesh." The mesh is made from the contents of numbered layers starting from layer 0 at genesis. Each layer is made of ordered lists of zero or more immutable data structures: blocks that contain transactions. The mesh consists of all layers from genesis to the present, as determined by the Spacemesh consensus protocol.

By design, the mesh doesn’t include any data regarding the _execution of transactions,_ and may include duplicate transactions in the same layer or even across different layers. The goal of the Spacemesh consensus protocol is to get all honest full nodes who participate in the protocol to agree on the contents of layers.

The contents of a layer (and therefore the mesh) can change over time while the Spacemesh protocol is executing. For example, the Tortoise protocol may change the contents of a layer as was determined by the execution of the Hare protocol. A self-healing process may change the content of past layers.

A transaction included in the mesh may fail to execute due to several conditions only known at runtime (i.e., the time when the full node actually attempts to execute the transaction _in situ_). Transaction processing doesn’t change the immutable transaction stored in the mesh. (See STF below.)

The mesh doesn't store any additional data besides the contents of layers described above. For example, it doesn't store transaction processing results or side effects. (TBD - does it include state root hashes of previous layers?)

## The Global State (meta-mesh)

The global state is an abstract data structure that includes all data, important to have a minimally viable cryptocurrency, that are not _explicitly_ stored in the mesh. These data can be _computed implicitly_ from mesh data, hence the term "meta mesh."

This includes the following:

1. The balance and nonce of each account.
1. The current state (and meta-data) of all app templates and instances deployed on the mesh, including code, balance, storage, etc.
1. The results of executing transactions, e.g. insufficient funds, invalid nonce, runtime error, out of gas, executed, etc. The data structure storing these results is called a transaction receipt.
1. Block rewards and transaction fees awarded to smeshers based on the contents of a previous layer.
1. App events: events emitted by execution of apps (see caveat below).

Full node core data includes both the mesh and the meta mesh and the Spacemesh data API should provide access to both mesh and meta mesh data.

### The STF (State Transition Function)

The global state data structure is only modified by the state transition function (STF). It cannot be modified any other way.

The STF is executed per layer, per transaction. The input to an STF running in layer `n` is:

1. An ordered unique list of transactions created from the contents of the layer.
1. The contents of a past layer (a network parameter, e.g., `n-4`) as input to rewards and tx fees processing.
1. The global state at layer `n-1`.

The output of the STF is the global state of layer `n`. This includes all changes to global state data members and new data items created by the STF, e.g., new reward events and new transaction receipts.

The STF executes the transaction from the list in sequence and is responsible for generating and storing a transaction receipt for each execution in the global state.

The transaction execution initiated by the STF modifies the global state on a per-transaction basis. So transaction `b` executed after transaction `a` should have the global state which includes changes to data created by the execution of transaction `a`.

Each transaction is executed based on its type: app transactions are executed by SVM and simple coin transactions by a coin transaction execution function. The STF is responsible for properly executing these transactions by using the SVM runtime and other transaction execution-specific modules.

In addition to processing all the transactions from a list, the STF should compute the rewards and the transaction fees for a past layer and update the state of the accounts that should receive rewards and transaction fees for that past layer. These rewards and fees modify the global state (account balances).

## Design Considerations

1. An STF for a specific layer number may be executed more than once because a layer’s contents may change (see mesh above). For example, the STF is executed when the Hare protocol agrees on the contents of a layer but will be executed again if the Tortoise protocol or a self healing protocol changes the contents of that layer.

1. The state root hash is a hash of the global state of a layer computed by the STF. It is a compact binary representation of the global state of a layer. It is not yet clear if the mesh will include state root hashes for previous layers in ATXs or blocks (see [discussion here](https://github.com/spacemeshos/research/issues/45)). If it is included then the STF can compare its own computed state root hash with the state root hash from the mesh and alert the user if there’s a mismatch. This is not as strong as the state validation features provided by most other major cryptocurrencies, but it can help to more quickly identify full node bugs and runtime errors.

1. Including the results of transaction execution (receipts) in the global state is an important product requirement for a cryptocurrency. Without these data, users have no way to know if a transaction they sent to the network (or one that was sent to them) was successfully executed or not, and if there was an error, what the error was (e.g., insufficient funds at execution time, a runtime error, etc.).

    - Empowering users to use a full node to know the results of their transactions instead of relying on a third party mainframe and "bank teller" is arguably one of the most basic feature of a cryptocurrency - a distributed transaction processing system where users submit transactions and can tell the effect of their transactions on coin balances and app state. There is no major cryptocurrency design which does not have this basic feature. It is hard to imagine from a user perspective a cryptocurrency without this feature. It will certainly not be very useful or usable to end users.

    - One of the most important features of crypto wallets is the ability to display the results of any transaction that touched the user's account. This has implications on the global state data and the Spacemesh data API design. It is quite hard to imagine a cryptocurrency that can’t tell its users the results of the most basic actions these users are interested in: executing financial transactions.

1. App events are only emitted via a full node low-level API as they are created, and not stored in global state. Maybe we can exclude them from the definition of the global state and think about them as emitted metadata by the STF that can be stored by full node clients if they subscribe to it (Tal's suggestion).

## Open Questions

1. What happens to transaction receipts created by the STF in a specific layer when it is executed again on the same layer? There needs to be a way to mark them as invalid or discard them as each executed transaction has a new receipt in the new STF execution.
1. Should transactions already executed by the STF in a previous layer be pruned from the input to an STF for a later layer in the case that the same transaction is also in the layer contents for that layer? If not, is the STF responsible for not executing a transaction again in this case, or should it just create an error receipt for this transaction?
1. Wallets need to be smart enough to inspect more than one transaction receipt for a transaction and display the relevant information to the user.
1. Can transaction receipts be pruned? Pruning transaction receipts means wallets lose the ability to display old transaction execution results. Perhaps only archive nodes keep all transaction receipts and full nodes prune them to reduce storage costs?

## Transaction Status

- Note that we currently mix between three kind of concerns in a single enum we call "transaction status":
  1. The transaction status on its journey to the mesh via a full node, a transaction pool, and inclusion in a block (rejected by mempool, pending in mempool, included in a block, confirmed, etc.)
  1. The status of the layer which includes a block with the transaction (confirmed, approved, etc.)
  1. The actual transaction processing status that resulted from execution of the transaction (succeeded, failed due to lack of funds, runtime error, etc.)
  
- We propose to refactor transaction result out of transaction state as follows:

1. Transaction State

The `TransactionState` is computed by a full node pre-STF and doesn't reflect any transaction processing by the STF, only transaction processing as far as the mempool and the mesh are concerned.

```
enum TransactionState {
    UNKNOWN = 0;               // Default state
    REJECTED = 1;              // Rejected pre STF processing. e.g. bad data
    INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS = 2;    // Rejected pre STF processing by funds check
    CONFLICTING = 3;           // Rejected pre STF due to conflicting counter
    PENDING = 4;               // Got to a block on the mesh. Pending processing by STF
    APPROVED = 5;              // In a mesh block that was approved.
    CONFIRMED = 6;             // In a mesh block that was confirmed.
}
```

Note that the fact that a transaction is in an `APPROVED` or `CONFIRMED` state doesn't mean that it was successfully executed (or executed at all), just that it was included in a block in a layer that was confirmed.

2. Transaction Result

`TransactionResult` encapsulates the results of transaction execution by the STF. The result can only be known once an STF attempted to execute the transaction.

```
enum TransactionResult {
    UNKNOWN = 0;                        // Not yet known
    EXECUTED = 1;                       // executed w/o error by the STF
    BAD_COUNTER = 2;                    // unexpected transaction counter
    RUNTIME_EXCEPTION = 3;              // app code exception
    INSUFFICIENT_GAS = 4;               // out of gas
    INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE = 5;           // failed due to sender's insufficient funds
}
```

The `TransactionResult` is one field of a `TransactionReceipt`. A `TransactionReceipt` also includes the layer number when the transaction was executed. Note that it is the only data structure that includes execution side effects such as gas used and transaction fee charged. Note that one transaction may result in multiple receipts, if the layer changes and is rerun later (as described above), or if the transaction is included in multiple layers.

```
message TransactionReceipt {
    TransactionId id = 1;           // the source transaction (immutable)
    TransactionResult result = 2;   // tx processing result
    uint64 gas_used = 3;            // gas units used by the transaction (gas price in tx)
    Amount fee = 4;                 // transaction fee charged for the transaction
    uint64 layer_number = 5;        // The layer in which the STF processed this transaction
}

enum TransactionType {
    SIMPLE = 0;             // simple coin transaction
    ATX = 1;                // smesher activation transaction
    APP = 2;                // smart contract method execution
    SPAWN_APP = 3;          // deploy app from template
    DEPLOY_TEMPLATE = 4;    // deploy app template code to mesh
}
```

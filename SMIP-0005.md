# Data Design

## Motivation

Spacemesh aims to build and release a minimally viable cryptocurrency mainnet which is powered by the Spacemesh consensus protocol. The primary use case of any cryptocurrency is the ability of anyone to transact w/o limitations. Transacting means the ability to submit transactions and to know the results of transactions executed by the system that a user may be involved in (as a sender, receiver, singer, etc...). Another important use case is smeshers getting rewards and transaction fees for honest participation in the protocol. For miners, it is utterly important to know exactly what fees and rewards they got credit for, in what time (layer) did they get rewarded and why did they get rewarded a specific amount in a layer.

The data required to implement these use cases on the most basic level does not live explicitly in the core Spacemesh distributed data structure we call the mesh due to the design of the Spacemesh consensus protocol.

This document aims to define what data needs to be collected, stored and made available by a Spacemesh node in a way will enable Spacemesh to be a minimally viable cryptocurrency.

Specifically, this document lays out what data will be stored by a Spacemesh full node in addition to the core mesh data required for the Spacemesh consensus protocol, and how and when these data should be computed by a Spacemesh full node. While there's team consensus about the contents of the mesh, further attention and thought are needed around what data are needed that are not explicitly stored on the mesh.

The Spacemesh [data API](https://github.com/spacemeshos/api) provides access to these data as mesh data alone is insufficient for many API consumers. A consensus on the above is required to design a functional API and to design API clients such as backup agents, explorers, wallets, and dashboards. All of these clients consume Spacemesh data and most of them require data beyond the basic, raw mesh data.

This formulation is important due to the special and unique design of the Spacemesh consensus protocol and mesh and the implication of the consensus protocol design on creating a functional cryptocurrency based on it.

## The Mesh
Core data that the Spacemesh protocol provides decentralized consensus on is called the "mesh." The mesh is made from the contents of numbered layers starting from layer 0 at genesis. Each layer is made of ordered lists of zero or more immutable data structures: blocks that contain transactions. The mesh consists of all layers from genesis to the present, as determined by the Spacemesh consensus protocol.

By design, the mesh doesn’t include any data regarding the _execution of transactions,_ and may include duplicate transactions in the same layer or even across different layers. The goal of the Spacemesh consensus protocol is to get all honest full nodes who participate in the protocol to agree on the contents of layers.

The contents of a layer (and therefore the mesh) can change over time while the Spacemesh protocol is executing. For example, the Tortoise protocol may change the contents of a layer as was determined by the execution of the Hare protocol. A self-healing process may change the content of past layers.

A transaction included in the mesh may fail to execute due to several conditions only known at runtime (i.e., the time when the full node actually attempts to execute the transaction _in situ_). Transaction processing doesn’t change the immutable transaction stored in the mesh. (See STF below.)

The mesh doesn't store any additional data besides the contents of layers described above. For example, it doesn't store transaction processing results or side effects. (TBD - does it include state root hashes of previous layers?)

## The Global State (meta-mesh)

The global state is an abstract data structure that includes all data that is not explicitly stored in the mesh which is important to have a minimally viable cryptocurrency.  

This data includes the following:
1. The balance and nonce of each coin account.
2. The current state (and meta-data) of all app instances deployed on the mesh.
4. The results of execution transactions. e.g. insufficient funds, invalid nonce, runtime error, out of gas, executed, etc.... The data structure storing these results is called a transaction receipt.
5. Block rewards and transaction fees awarded to smeshers based on the content of a previous layer.
6. App events. Events emitted by execution of apps (see caveat below).

> Full node core data includes both the mesh and the uber-mesh and Spacemsh data API should provide access to both mesh and uber-mesh data.

### The STF (State Transaction Function)

The global state data structure is only modified by the state transition function - STF and should not be modified by any other way.

The STF is executed on a per layer basis.

The input to an STF running in layer n is:
1. An ordered unique list of transactions created from the contents of the layer.
2. The contents of a past layer (a network param. e.g. n-4) as input to rewards and tx fees processing
3. The global state at layer n-1.

The output of the STF is the global state of layer n. This includes all changes to global state data members and new data items created by the STF. For example, new reward events and new transaction receipts.

The STF executes the transaction from the list in a sequential order and is responsible for the creation of a transaction receipt for each execution and storing the receipt in the global state.

The transaction execution initiated by the STF is modifying the global state on a per-transaction basis. So a transaction b executed after transaction a should have the global state which includes changes to data created by the execution of transaction a.

Each transaction is executed based on its type. E.g. app transactions are executed by SVM and simple coin transactions by a coin transaction execution function. The STF is responsible to properly execute these transactions by using the SVM runtime and other transaction execution specific modules.

In addition to processing all the transactions from a list, the STF should compute the rewards and the transaction fees for a past layer (for example, layer n-4) and update the state of the accounts that should receive rewards and transaction fees for that layer. These rewards and fees modify the global state (account balances).

## Design Considerations

1.  An STF for a specific layer number may be executed more than once because a layer’s content may change (see mesh above). For example, the STF is executed when the Hare protocol agrees on the contents of a layer but will be executed again if the Tortoise protocol or a self healing protocol changes the content of that layer.

2. The state root hash is a hash the global state of a layer. It should be computed by the STF. It is a compact binary representation of the global state of a layer. It is not yet clear if the mesh will include state root hashes for previous layers in ATXs or blocks. If such inclusion is designed then the STF can compare its own computed state root hash with state root hash from the mesh and alert the user if there’s a mismatch. This is not as strong as the state validation features provided by most other major cryptocurrencies but can help to identify full node bugs and runtime errors.

3. Including results of transactions execution in the global state is an important product requirement for a cryptocurrency. Without this data, users have no way to know if a transaction they sent to the network (or were on the receiving side of) was executed or not and what was the cause of the error in case the transaction wasn’t executed. (for example, insufficient funds at execution time, a runtime error, etc…).

  - Empowering users to use a full node to know the results of their transactions processing instead of relying on a bank mainframe and teller is arguably one of the most basic feature of a cryptocurrency - a distributed transaction processing system where users submit transactions and can tell what was the effect of their transactions on coin balances and app state. There is not even 1 major cryptocurrency design which does not have this feature. It is hard to imagine from a user-perspective a cryptocurrency without this feature. It will certainly not be very useful or usable to end users.

  - One of the most important features of crypto wallets is to display to its user the results of any transaction he initiated by the wallet or that an account in the user's wallet was part of. This has implications on the global state data and the Spacemesh data api designs. It is quite hard to imagine a cryptocurrency that can’t tell its users the results of the most basic actions these users use the cryptocurrency for - executing financial transactions.

4. App event can be only emitted via a full node low-level API as they are created, and not stored in global state. Maybe we can exclude them from the definition of the global state and think about them as emitted meta-data by the STF that can be stored by full node clients if they subscribe to it. (Tal's suggestion).

## Open Design questions
1. What happens to transaction receipts created by an execution of the STF in a specific layer when it is executed again on the same layer? There needs to be a way to mark them as invalid or discard them as each executed transaction has a new receipt in the new STF execution.
2. Should transactions already executed by the STF in a previous layer be pruned from the input to an STF for a later layer in the case that the same transaction is also in the layer contents for that layer? If not, is the STF responsible not to execute a transaction again in this case or to just create an error receipt for this transaction?
3. Wallets need to be smart enough to inspect more than one transaction receipt for a transaction and display to the user the relevant information.
4. Can transaction receipts be pruned? Pruning transaction receipts means loss of ability of wallets to display old transaction execution results. Perhaps only archive nodes keep all transaction receipts and full nodes prune them to reduce storage costs?

## Transaction State considerations
- Note that we currently mix between 3 kind of concerns in 1 enum we call transaction status: 1. The transaction status on its journey to them mesh the mesh via a full node, a transaction pool and a block. 2. The status of the layer which includes a block with the transaction (confirmed, approved, etc...) 3. The actual transaction processing status as resulted from execution of this transaction.
- We propose to refactor transaction result out of transaction state as follows:

```
1. Transaction State
The transaction state is computed by a full node pre STF and doesn't reflect any transaction processing by the STF - only transaction processing as far as the mem-pool and the mesh are concerned.

enum TransactionState {
    UNKNOWN = 0;             // Default state
    REJECTED = 1;               // Rejected pre STF processing. e.g. bad data
    INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS = 2;     // Rejected pre STF processing by funds check
    CONFLICTING = 3;       // Rejected pre STF due to conflicting counter
    PENDING = 4;               // Got to a block on the mesh. Pending processing by STF
    APPROVED = 5;           // In a mesh block that was approved.
    CONFIRMED = 6;         // In a mesh block that was confirmed.
}
```

Note that the fact that a transaction is in an approved or confirmed state doesn't mean it was executed nor that it was successfully executed.

2. Transaction Result
This encapsulate the results of transaction execution by the STF. The result can only be known once an STF attempted to execute the transaction.

// The results of STF transaction processing
```
enum TransactionResult {
    UNKNOWN = 0;                        // Not yet known
    EXECUTED = 1;                       // executed w/o error by the STF
    BAD_COUNTER = 2;                    // unexpected transaction counter
    RUNTIME_EXCEPTION = 3;              // app code exception
    INSUFFICIENT_GAS = 4;               // out of gas
    INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE = 5;           // failed due to sender's insufficient funds
}
```

Transaction result for a transaction is filed of a Transaction Receipt. A transaction receipt will include the layer number when the transaction was executed. Note that it is the only data structure that includes execution side effects such as gas used and transaction fee charged.

```
message TransactionReceipt {
    TransactionId id = 1;  // the source transaction
    TransactionResult result = 2;   // tx processing result
    uint64 gas_used = 3;            // gas units used by the transaction (gas price in tx)
    Amount fee = 4;                 // transaction fee charged for the transaction
    uint64 layer_number = 5;       // The layer in which the STF processed this transaction
}

enum TransactionType {
    SIMPLE = 0;            // simple coin transaction
    ATX = 1;             // smesher activation transaction
    APP = 2;             // smart contract method execution
    SPAWN_APP = 3;          // deploy app from template
    DEPLOY_TEMPLATE = 4; // deploy app template code to mesh
}
```

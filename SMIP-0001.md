## What is an SMIP?

SMIP stands for Spacemesh Improvement Proposal. An SMIP is a design document providing information to the Spacemesh community, or describing a new feature for Spacemesh or its processes or environment. The Spacemesh should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The Spacemesh author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## SMIP Rationale

We intend SMIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Spacemesh. Because the SMIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For Spacemesh implementers, SMIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the SMIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.

## History

This document was derived heavily from [Spacemesh SMIP-0001] which was heavily derived from [Bitcoin's BIP-0001] written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived from [Python's PEP-0001]. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in the Spacemesh Improvement Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Spacemesh or the SMIP. Please direct all comments to the SMIP editors.

## SMIP Types

There are three types of SMIP:

- A **Standard Track SMIP** describes any change that affects most or all Spacemesh implementations, such as a change to the the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Spacemesh. Furthermore Standard SMIPs can be broken down into the following categories. Standards Track SMIPs consist of three parts, a design document, implementation, and finally if warranted an update to the [formal specification].

  - **Core** - improvements requiring a consensus fork, as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to as well as proposed improvements to network protocol specifications.

  - **Interface** - includes improvements around client [API/RPC] specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names and programs binary interface. The label “interface” aligns with the [interfaces repo] and discussion should primarily occur in that repository before an SMIP is submitted to the SMIPs repository.

  - **APPs** - application-level standards and conventions, including programs standards such as token standards, name registries, URI schemes, library/package formats, and wallet formats .


- An **Informational SMIP** describes a Spacemesh design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Spacemesh community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational SMIPs do not necessarily represent Spacemesh community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational SMIPs or follow their advice.

- A **Meta SMIP** describes a process surrounding Spacemesh or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process SMIPs are like Standards Track SMIPs but apply to areas other than the Spacemesh protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Spacemesh's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational SMIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Spacemesh development. Any meta-SMIP is also considered a Process SMIP.

It is highly recommended that a single SMIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the SMIP, the more successful it tends to be. A change to one client doesn't require an SMIP; a change that affects multiple clients, or defines a standard for multiple apps to use, does.

An SMIP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a `clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement`. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

## SMIP Work Flow

Parties involved in the process are you, the champion or *SMIP author*, the [*SMIP editors*](#smip-editors), and the [*Spacemesh Core Developers*](https://spacemesh.io).

:warning: Before you begin, vet your idea, this will save you time.

- Ask the Spacemesh community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be be rejected based on prior research (searching the Internet does not always do the trick).

- It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Spacemesh is used. Examples of appropriate public forums to gauge interest around your SMIP include [the Spacemesh subreddit], [the Issues section of this repository], and [one of the Spacemesh Gitter chat rooms]. In particular, [the Issues section of this repository] is an excellent place to discuss your proposal with the community and start creating more formalized language around your SMIP.

Your role as *the champion* is to write the SMIP using the style and format described below, shepherd the discussions in the appropriate forums, and build community consensus around the idea. Following is the process that a successful SMIP will move along:

```
[ WIP ] -> [ DRAFT ] -> [ LAST CALL ] -> [ ACCEPTED ] -> [ FINAL ]
```

Each status change is requested by the SMIP author and reviewed by the SMIP editors. Use a pull request to update the status. Please include a link to where people should continue discussing your SMIP. The SMIP editors will process these requests as per the conditions below.

* **Work in progress (WIP)** -- Once the champion has asked the Spacemesh community whether an idea has any chance of support, they will write a draft SMIP as a [pull request]. Consider including an implementation if this will aid people in studying the SMIP.
  * :arrow_right: Draft -- If agreeable, SMIP editor will assign the SMIP a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the SMIP) and merge your pull request. The SMIP editor will not unreasonably deny an SMIP.
  * :x: Draft -- Reasons for denying draft status include being too unfocused, too broad, duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the [Spacemesh philosophy](https://github.com/Spacemesh/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#philosophy).
* **Draft** -- Once the first draft has been merged, you may submit follow-up pull requests with further changes to your draft until such point as you believe the SMIP to be mature and ready to proceed to the next status. An SMIP in draft status must be implemented to be considered for promotion to the next status (ignore this requirement for core SMIPs).
  * :arrow_right: Last Call -- If agreeable, the SMIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date, normally 14 days later.
  * :x: Last Call -- A request for Last Call status will be denied if material changes are still expected to be made to the draft. We hope that SMIPs only enter Last Call once, so as to avoid unnecessary noise on the RSS feed. Last Call will be denied if the implementation is not complete and supported by the community.
* **Last Call** -- This SMIP will listed prominently on the http://SMIPs.Spacemesh.org/ website (subscribe via RSS at [last-call.xml](/last-call.xml)).
  * :x: -- A Last Call which results in material changes or substantial unaddressed complaints will cause the SMIP to revert to Draft.
  * :arrow_right: Accepted (Core SMIPs only) -- After the review end date, the Spacemesh Core Developers will vote on whether to accept this change. If yes, the status will upgrade to Accepted.
  * :arrow_right: Final (Not core SMIPs) -- A successful Last Call without material changes or unaddressed complaints will become Final.
* **Accepted (Core SMIPs only)** -- This is being implemented by Spacemesh Core Developers.
  * :arrow_right: Final -- Standards Track Core SMIPs must be implemented in at least three viable Spacemesh clients before it can be considered Final. When the implementation is complete and supported by the community, the status will be changed to “Final”.
* **Final** -- This SMIP represents the current state-of-the-art. A Final SMIP should only be updated to correct errata.

Other exceptional statuses include:

* Deferred -- This is for core SMIPs that have been put off for a future hard fork.
* Rejected -- An SMIP that is fundamentally broken and will not be implemented.
* Active -- This is similar to Final, but denotes an SMIP which which may be updated without changing its SMIP number.
* Superseded -- An SMIP which was previously final but is no longer considered state-of-the-art. Another SMIP will be in Final status and reference the Superseded SMIP.

## What belongs in a successful SMIP?

Each SMIP should have the following parts:

- `Preamble` - RFC 822 style headers containing metadata about the SMIP, including the SMIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), and the author details. See [below](https://github.com/Spacemesh/SMIPs/blob/master/SMIPS/SMIP-1.md#SMIP-header-preamble) for details.
- `Simple Summary` - “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SMIP.
- `Abstract` - a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.
- `Motivation` (*optional) - The motivation is critical for SMIPs that want to change the Spacemesh protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the SMIP solves. SMIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
- `Specification` - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Spacemesh platforms (cpp-Spacemesh, go-Spacemesh, parity, SpacemeshJ, Spacemeshjs-lib, [and others](https://github.com/Spacemesh/wiki/wiki/Clients).
- `Rationale` - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
- `Backwards Compatibility` - All SMIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The SMIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. SMIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.
- `Test Cases` - Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SMIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other SMIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.
- `Implementations` - The implementations must be completed before any SMIP is given status “Final”, but it need not be completed before the SMIP is merged as draft. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of “rough consensus and running code” is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
- `Copyright Waiver` - All SMIPs must be in the public domain. See the bottom of this SMIP for an example copyright waiver.

## SMIP Formats and Templates

SMIPs should be written in [markdown] format.
Image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that SMIP as follow: `assets/SMIP-X` (for SMIP **X**). When linking to an image in the SMIP, use relative links such as `../assets/SMIP-X/image.png`.

## SMIP Header Preamble

Each SMIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble, preceded and followed by three hyphens (`---`). The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

` SMIP:` <SMIP number> (this is determined by the SMIP editor)

` title:` <SMIP title>

` author:` <a list of the author's or authors' name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s). Details are below.>

` * discussions-to:` <url>

` status:` <Draft | Last Call | Accepted | Final | Active | Deferred | Rejected | Superseded>

`* review-period-end: YYYY-MM-DD

` type: `<Standards Track (Core, Networking, Interface, ERC)  | Informational | Meta>

` * category:` <Core | Networking | Interface | ERC>

` created:` <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>

` * requires:` <SMIP number(s)>

` * replaces:` <SMIP number(s)>

` * superseded-by:` <SMIP number(s)>

` * resolution:` <url>

#### Author header

The author header optionally lists the names, email addresses or usernames of the authors/owners of the SMIP. Those who prefer anonymity may use a username only, or a first name and a username. The format of the author header value must be:

Random J. User &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;

or

Random J. User (@username)

if the email address or GitHub username is included, and

Random J. User

if the email address is not given.

Note: The resolution header is required for Standards Track SMIPs only. It contains a URL that should point to an email message or other web resource where the pronouncement about the SMIP is made.

While an SMIP is a draft, a discussions-to header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the SMIP is being discussed. As mentioned above, examples for places to discuss your SMIP include [Spacemesh topics on Gitter](https://gitter.im/Spacemesh/topics), an issue in this repo or in a fork of this repo, [Spacemesh Magicians](https://Spacemesh-magicians.org/) (this is suitable for SMIPs that may be contentious or have a strong governance aspect), and [Reddit r/Spacemesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemesh/). No discussions-to header is necessary if the SMIP is being discussed privately with the author.

The type header specifies the type of SMIP: Standards Track, Meta, or Informational. If the track is Standards please include the subcategory (core, networking, interface, or ERC).

The category header specifies the SMIP's category. This is required for standards-track SMIPs only.

The created header records the date that the SMIP was assigned a number. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

SMIPs may have a requires header, indicating the SMIP numbers that this SMIP depends on.

SMIPs may also have a superseded-by header indicating that an SMIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the SMIP that replaces the current document. The newer SMIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the SMIP that it rendered obsolete.

Headers that permit lists must separate elements with commas.

## Auxiliary Files

SMIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files must be named SMIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where “XXXX” is the SMIP number, “Y” is a serial number (starting at 1), and “ext” is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. “png”).

## Transferring SMIP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of SMIPs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred SMIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the SMIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or isn't responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the SMIP. We try to build consensus around an SMIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing SMIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of an SMIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the SMIP editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the SMIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :)).

## SMIP Editors

The current SMIP editors are

` * Iddo Bentov (iddobentov@spacemesh.io)`

` * Aviv Eyal (ae@spacemesh.io)`

## SMIP Editor Responsibilities

For each new SMIP that comes in, an editor does the following:

- Read the SMIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to get to final status.
- The title should accurately describe the content.
- Check the SMIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (Github flavored Markdown), code style

If the SMIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the SMIP is ready for the repository, the SMIP editor will:

- Assign an SMIP number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author, the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository about this SMIP)

- Merge the corresponding pull request

- Send a message back to the SMIP author with the next step.

Many SMIPs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the Spacemesh codebase. The SMIP editors monitor SMIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

The editors don't pass judgment on SMIPs. We merely do the administrative & editorial part.
